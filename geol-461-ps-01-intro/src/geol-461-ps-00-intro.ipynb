    "# Geochemistry 461: Python Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Learn Python Programming in Geochemistry ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any geochemistry study requires some form of the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get data (simulation, experiment, field collection)\n",
    "2. Manipulate, process data, and test with theoretical or conceptual models\n",
    "3. Visualize results, quickly to understand, but also with high quality figures, for reports or publications\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://docs.python.org/3.7/) provides a powerful environment for this kind of work because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batteries included** Rich collection of already existing bricks of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools. We don’t want to re-program the plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform or a fitting algorithm. Don’t reinvent the wheel!\n",
    "- **Easy to learn** Most scientists are not payed as programmers, neither have they been trained so. They need to be able to draw a curve, smooth a signal, do a Fourier transform in a few minutes.\n",
    "- **Easy communication** To keep code alive within a lab or a company it should be as readable as a book by collaborators, students, or maybe customers. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.\n",
    "- **Efficient code** Python numerical modules are computationally efficient. But needless to say that a very fast code becomes useless if too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development times and quick execution times.\n",
    "- **Universal Python** is a language used for many different problems. Learning Python avoids learning a new software for each new problem.\n",
    "- **Free software** released under an open-source license: Python can be used and distributed free of charge, even for building commercial software. \n",
    "- **Multi-platform** Python is available for all major operating systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X"

    "## Python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is modular and uses libraries to accomplish specific tasks or objectives. The most important libraries that we'll load almost every coding session are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "[NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/whatisnumpy.html) is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/overview.html) is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each notebook or script, you have to import the needed Python packages.  This is done with the `import` function.  Each library is given a shorthand abbreviation to shorten the code and make it more readable.  Any function within the imported libary can then be called by using hte abbreviation, followed by a period.  For example, numpy contains a function for the number pi and be imported by typing: `np.pi`\n",
